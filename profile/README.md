# solInfer

solInfer is a project to create a unified framework for inference with neural networks. The project has not started yet, but this organization is here to keep the name available for when it starts.
 
Our planned subprojects:

* **solInfer** - Framework to inference neural networks using many different neural network libraries as backends.
* **solGet** - Framework to download and manage models and other large resources that are needed by multiple applications.
* **solDaemon** - Daemon that passes on requests to solGet and solInfer, and manages application access to hardware resources and downloads models.
* **solInferBench** - Benchmark of the backends of solInfer on various hardware

Please [open a discussion](https://github.com/solInfer/.github/discussions/new/choose) if you'd like to help out.
